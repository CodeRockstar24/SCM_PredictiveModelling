# SCM_PredictiveModelling
Supply Chain Predictive Modeling Web App using Streamlit. Features LSTM demand forecasting, inventory optimization, customer segmentation, and statistical testing. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn, Plotly, and Statsmodels for interactive, data‑driven SCM insights.

The SupplyChainManagement Modelling project is organized for streamlined development and deployment. The .streamlit directory contains configuration files and a data folder, which holds resources such as datagenerator.ipynb and the main dataset ecommerce_supply_chain.csv. The core application resides in the streamlit_app folder, with a pages subdirectory that separates functionality into four main modules: 01_1️⃣forcastdemand.py (forecasting demand with LSTM), 02_2️⃣inventoryoptimisation.py (inventory optimization), 03_3️⃣customer_segmentation.py (customer and product segmentation), and 04_4️⃣statisticaltests.py (statistical hypothesis testing). Supporting files such as the project license, README, and requirements.txt for dependencies are located in the root directory, making the project easy to navigate and maintain.

1️⃣ Forecast Future Demand (LSTM Model)
What it does:
Leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future demand from historical sales data. Users can select an SKU to generate a detailed one-year demand forecast.

How it works:
The sales data is preprocessed to address non-stationarity and smooth fluctuations. The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for robust validation. The LSTM model learns temporal patterns and forecasts future demand trends.

Output:

Interactive time-series plot showing historical sales, test predictions, and future forecasts.

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for model accuracy evaluation.

Downloadable forecast table for deeper analysis.

2️⃣ Inventory Optimisation & Demand Simulation
What it does:
Enables smart inventory planning using:

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) – Calculates optimal order size to minimise total costs.

Safety Stock – Estimates buffer stock to avoid stockouts during demand fluctuations.

Monte Carlo Simulation – Models thousands of possible demand outcomes to measure uncertainty.

How it works:
Users pick an SKU to view its EOQ and safety stock. The simulation generates 1000+ demand variations using historical averages and variability to project risk.

Output:

EOQ & Safety Stock displayed in a summary table.

Demand distribution histogram for variability analysis.

Interactive visuals to assess trends and supply chain resilience.

3️⃣ Customer & Product Segmentation
What it does:
Delivers performance insights based on product movement and customer activity:

Sales by Supplier – Identify high-impact suppliers.

Sales by Product Family & Category – Spot best-performing items.

Top & Bottom Customers – Rank by revenue contribution.

Stock Turnover Ratio – Evaluate inventory movement efficiency.

How it works:
Aggregates sales, revenue, and stock levels across categories, suppliers, and products. Presents metrics through interactive charts and tables.

Output:

Top & bottom 20 SKUs by sales and turnover ratio.

Supplier-wise performance trends.

Customer segmentation by revenue.

4️⃣ Statistical Hypothesis Testing
What it does:
Performs five statistical tests to validate supply chain insights:

Pearson Correlation – Stock level vs sales.

Linear Regression – Lead time vs sales.

Kruskal-Wallis Test – Supplier revenue differences.

Spearman Correlation – Purchase frequency vs revenue.

ANOVA – Revenue variation across categories.

How it works:
Users choose a hypothesis from a dropdown, the app runs the test, and outputs p-values with interpretation.

Output:

Test statistic & p-value vs α = 0.05.

Decision to reject or retain H₀.

Optional visualisation of test distribution and rejection zones.
